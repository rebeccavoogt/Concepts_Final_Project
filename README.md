# Concepts_Final_Project
Final project for Concepts in Computer Programming course written in Python

- This code was used for my final project in a Concepts in Computer Programming course.
- The basic idea is a menu, but for ordering animals at the zoo. 
- Typing 'manager' in the text prompt will enter manager mode to change prices and specials.
- The program will add up the items you order and present you with a running total at any point.
- Ordering multiple of the same item is allowed.
- The program will present you with a receipt at the end of your order.
